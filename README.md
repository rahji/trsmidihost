# TRS MIDI Host
A PCB that adds TRS MIDI jacks to the [Hobbytronics USB MIDI Host PCB](https://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/usb-host-midi)

Sorry, I'm being lazy by not including PNGs of the schematic or PCB. Files are in Diptrace format and the Gerber ZIP file is ready to be uploaded to a PCB fab. This board is based on the schematic from Hobbytronics. I have made it and haven't gotten it to work with the MIDI gear I've got, so you'll have to let me know if it works for you.

## BOM

* 1 x Sharp PC900V optocoupler. It's discontinued, but I salvaged one from an old piece of MIDI gear. If you substitute, realize that the pinout is likely to be different.
* 2 x Switchcraft 35RAPC4BH3. A bit pricey. Again if you substitute, you'll have to change the PCB layout.
* 1 x 1N914 diode
* 1 x 220Ω resistor
* 2 x 75Ω resistors
* 1 x 9-pin header (2.54 mm pitch), male or female depending on the pins you've got on the Hobbytronics PCB
* 1 x 2-pin header (2.54 mm pitch)
